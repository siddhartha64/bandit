Ssh-ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. 
It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network

ssh user_name@host(IP/Domain_name)  
bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 where “2220” is the port number
While logged into the bandit0 user profile, I ran the “ls” command to see if I find any useful files. The output showed that there is a file named “README”
