Ssh-ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. 
It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network

ssh user_name@host(IP/Domain_name)  
bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 where “2220” is the port number
While logged into the bandit0 user profile, I ran the “ls” command to see if I find any useful files. The output showed that there is a file named “README”

in this level we have a file which special character so to cat it we use ”./” or “<”

In order to read files with spaces in the name, you have to put the file name in quotation marks, or we can use backslash.

to see a hidden file with all other fileswe use ls -a 

# level 4
in this level use ls -la so we get the information of every file in directory and find for a ascii test in it

i used a command called find which have options  -size, -type, and -executable option
ind -type f -size 1033c

/ from root folder

-user the owner of the file.

-group the group owner of the file.

-size the size of the file.

2>&1 redirects error messages to null so that they do not show on stdout.

# level 7
cat data.txt | grep millionth

The command only return 1 line and it contained the password:

# level 8


in this i sorted all files using sort and found the count of each string using uniq -c   conut i could have used -u which he retrive the single line which wasnt repeating

# level 9

the file contains both strings and binary data which can make it difficult to read. In order to sort out the plain text I ran "cat data.txt | string". The next part is to grep the lines that start with the = sign

strings - finds and prints text strings embedded in binary files such as executables.

# level 10

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data
The data.txt contains 1 line that was encoded in base64. In order to decode the file I ran the command below:

# level 11

he data.txt file contains 1 line that was encrypted with the ROT13 algorithm. In order to decrypt it, I have to replace every letter by the letter 13 positions ahead. For example, with this encryption the letter a would be replaced with n. The word banana would encrypt to onanan. To decrypt the line I ran the command below:

cat data.txt | tr '[A-Z a-z]' '[N-Z A-M n-z a-m]'

The command above send the line to stdout where tr shifts every letter 13 positions. After running that command the output
