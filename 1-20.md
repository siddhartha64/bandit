Ssh-ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. 
It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network

ssh user_name@host(IP/Domain_name)  
bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 where “2220” is the port number
While logged into the bandit0 user profile, I ran the “ls” command to see if I find any useful files. The output showed that there is a file named “README”

In order to read files with spaces in the name, you have to put the file name in quotation marks, or we can use backslash.

to see a hidden file with all other fileswe use ls -a 

# level 4
in this level use ls -la so we get the information of every file in directory and find for a ascii test in it

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all the following properties:

# level 7
cat data.txt | grep millionth

The command only return 1 line and it contained the password:

grep is used to find pattern

in this i sorted all files using sort and found the count of each string using uniq -c   conut i could have used -u which he retrive the single line which wasnt repeating

# level 9

the file contains both strings and binary data which can make it difficult to read. In order to sort out the plain text I ran "cat data.txt | string". The next part is to grep the lines that start with the = sign

strings - finds and prints text strings embedded in binary files such as executables.

# level 10

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data
The data.txt contains 1 line that was encoded in base64. In order to decode the file I ran the command below:

# level 11

he data.txt file contains 1 line that was encrypted with the ROT13 algorithm. In order to decrypt it, I have to replace every letter by the letter 13 positions ahead. For example, with this encryption the letter a would be replaced with n. The word banana would encrypt to onanan. To decrypt the line I ran the command below:

cat data.txt | tr '[A-Z a-z]' '[N-Z A-M n-z a-m]'

The command above send the line to stdout where tr shifts every letter 13 positions. After running that command the output

in this level we comprassing and decompress different kinds of files


# level 13
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you dont get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

When I logged into the machine and I ran "ls" I saw a file named sshkey.private which must be the SSH private key the hint was talking about. In order to log into the bandit14 users profile I ran "ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost". The -i means that I am using an identity file in order to login to bandit14 on the server since all of the bandit users are on the same machine. After I logged into bandit14 I ran "cd /etc/bandit_pass/" as specified on the hint and then I read file bandit14 which gave us the next password
