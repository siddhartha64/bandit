Ssh-ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. 
It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network

ssh user_name@host(IP/Domain_name)  
bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 where “2220” is the port number
While logged into the bandit0 user profile, I ran the “ls” command to see if I find any useful files. The output showed that there is a file named “README”

to see a hidden file with all other fileswe use ls -a <br>

# level 4
in this level use ls -la so we get the information of every file in directory and find for a ascii test in it <br>

in this i sorted all files using sort and found the count of each string using uniq -c  , i could have used -u which he retrive the single line which wasnt repeating<br>

# level 9

the file contains both strings and binary data which can make it difficult to read. In order to sort out the plain text I ran "cat data.txt | string". The next part is to grep the lines that start with the = sign<br>

strings - finds and prints text strings embedded in binary files such as executables.<br>

# level 10

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data<br>
The data.txt contains 1 line that was encoded in base64. In order to decode the file I ran the command below:<br>

# level 11

the data.txt file contains 1 line that was encrypted with the ROT13 algorithm. In order to decrypt it, I have to replace every letter by the letter 13 positions ahead. For example, with this encryption the letter a would be replaced with n. The word banana would encrypt to onanan. To decrypt the line I ran the command below:<br>

cat data.txt | tr '[A-Z a-z]' '[N-Z A-M n-z a-m]'<br>

The command above send the line to stdout where tr shifts every letter 13 positions. After running that command the output <br>

by reading the data we can uderstand it is bin file <br>
The xxd command allows you to create a hex dump from a file.but it only displays the file you cant edit it.so we make a new file to dump the data into to.<br>
we use "file filname "  to determine the type of a file.
GZIP is a compression technology frequently used for transferring data quickly over the internet. before decompressing a gzip convert the name of the file to file.gz <br>
use " gzip -d filename   "<br>
bzip2 typically achieves a higher compression ratio than gzip, especially for text files, but it is also slower and more CPU-intensive.before decompressing a bzip2 <br>
convert the name of the file to .bz2<br>
use " bzip2 -d filename   "
<br>tar.gz file is a combination of a .tar file and a .gz file. It is an archive file with several other files inside it, which is then compressed<br>
x – instructs tar to extract the files from the zipped file<br>
f – tells tar the filename you want it to work on<br>




in this level we extract  different kinds of files


# level 13
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you dont get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.<br>

When I logged into the machine and I ran "ls" I saw a file named sshkey.private which must be the SSH private key the hint was talking about. In order to log into the bandit14 users profile I ran "ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost". The -i means that I am using an identity file in order to login to bandit14 on the server since all of the bandit users are on the same machine. After I logged into bandit14 I ran "cd /etc/bandit_pass/" as specified on the hint and then I read file bandit14 which gave us the next password<br>

The s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS.<br>

 the correct password as see if we get the password for the next level. The password for the current level can be found at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15

first we do a nmap scan to find open ports<br>

nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
 After connecting to the 31790 port with "openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790" and entering the password for bandit16 I received a private RSA key.<br>

now using that we can use rsa key to login, all passwords are stored in the /etc/bandit_pass folder which I "cd" into and then I ran the "cat bandit17" command and I was able to get the password which I tried and I was able to login<br>

here are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new <br>
